# SillyRatings   
SillyRatings is a web project that aims to create a dynamic and user-friendly movie review website where users can explore, review, and discuss their favorite movies. The website offers a vast database of movies spanning various genres, ratings, and release years.

## Features
- User registration using email or social media accounts
- Movie search and review using **OMDb API**
- Latest Hollywood news using **News API**
- Best moments of Oscars
- Best movies of various genres
- Top-rated TV shows in sitcom and drama categories
- Contact Us and About Us pages



###I took charge of designing and implementing the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a clean and smooth user experience. I also integrated JavaScript features for a more interactive interface.

##What’s Next? 
While I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, all the upcoming improvements will be driven by me. Based on my daily learning journey, I’m excited to implement new skills and knowledge as I dive deeper into web development.

Here are some planned enhancements:
-React-based TV show pages for sitcoms and dramas, using props for better reusability.
-Connecting the Sign-In and Contact Us pages to a fully functioning backend.
-Refining the UI/UX to enhance the overall user experience.
Each update will be a reflection of my personal growth in this field. I’m excited to continue developing this project, one step at a time. Stay tuned for more updates and features coming soon!
